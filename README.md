# IMOinLEAN
_A collection of formalisations in the [LEAN](https://leanprover.github.io/) interactive theorem prover._

This repository contains solutions to four IMO problems and a formalisation of the Jördan–Holder theorem of group theory. You can read more about this theorem [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_series#Uniqueness:_Jordan%E2%80%93H%C3%B6lder_theorem) and [here](https://brilliant.org/wiki/jordan-holder/).

The scripts of the IMO exams can be found [here](https://www.imo-official.org/problems.aspx) (select year and language and then click download). There are also model solutions for the [2017](https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2017SL.pdf) and [2014](https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2014SL.pdf) shortlisted problems.
